# batch2-BLU11-instructors

## What is in this BLU?

In this learning unit, we learn about time and space complexity. We learn how to deal with it using two fundamental pillars of RS: sparse matrices and linear algebra. Then, armed with these new tools, we explore personalized RS. To build a solid intuition about the main components and the pipeline of such systems, we focus on simple memory-based approaches of content-based and collaborative-filtering, the industry standards. Ready for some fun?
